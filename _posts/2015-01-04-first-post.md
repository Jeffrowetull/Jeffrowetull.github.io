title: Elon Musk, Twitter Wizard?

---

Elon Musk is quite the character on Twitter. He is extremely active and will respond to any tweets. He is not afraid to make outlandish claims, jokes, or insults. This can get him into some trouble like his tweets about the cave diver and attacking Tesla short-sellers. Some of his more costly tweets were an April fools joke about his company Tesla being bankrupt and another that said Tesla was going private at $420. The former caused his stock to dip 7% while the latter caused the SEC to begin an investigation on stock manipulation after rising 11%.

Is Elon Musk some sort of Twitter wizard?
To find a wizard, you need evidence and history. I got a time period of roughly four years, 2013 -2017, of both Elon’s tweets and the price of Tesla from datasets available here and here, respectively . First I began with a graph showing all of that.


Now lets look at the number of tweets by month and year.



Elon tweeted a lot in 2013 around when Tesla’s price started to shoot up. The years 2014 and 2015 don’t have as many tweets as the others but there’s a certain rise and fall that follows… or leads the stock level. There’s huge activity in 2016 and 2017 as well.

What does Elon tweet about? What are his magic words?


Word cloud of Elon’s most common words
Naturally, Elon is mostly tweeting about his work. Both Tesla and SpaceX feature prominent spots in the word cloud. Maybe repetition is a part of a strong Twitter spell?

Specifically, Tesla
A good wizard will conceal their spell. Given our history with witches, it makes sense. The data must be purged of irrelevant tweets.


Now the real spell can be revealed! Using a little statistical magic of my own, I conjured a test to compare the tweets against the peaks and dips of the stock price. I conclude there is a correlation between the number of tweets Elon submits and the price of Tesla stock. Of course, this is probably reactionary on Elon’s part rather than any real spells.
