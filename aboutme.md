My high score in the dinosaur game is 1343.
I love to automate things. That is what got me interested in data science and coding in general. 
One quote on the subject I like to take to heart is "I'd do everything in my power if it meant that someone else would do nothing."
That is a quote from the television show Parks & Rec and it wasn't about automation at all, rather limiting the power of the 
government. However, it still applies to my situation as I see it.
